## Article findings

One link I found really interesting on the article is [github explore](https://github.com/explore). I only use github for my own projects, but I forgot that there are many other one's on there as well. Github.com/explore matches open issues based on my own interests. I find this very useful in narrowing down my search because I am more likely to contribute to an issue if I am familiar with it's syntax and environment. For example, the first thing github explore shows me is an issue on ``` .post(), .put(), and .patch() functions in API docs missing 'files' parameter```. I have experience using post, put and patch; therefore fixing this issue still would take some time, but not as long as learning something from scratch.

Another link I found to be really helpful is from the [first timer's only](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) link. In there I found a readme much like the one in class, but with pictures for each step. 

From the article itself, I found out that 28% of casual contributions are just fixing typos, reformatting or writing a translation. This statement takes a load off my chest, because something as simple as this can still count as a contribution.

## Comments about this week's git activity

This week's github lesson on making contribution was a bit confusing at first. The procedure for updating the master repo from a forked repo was not as easy as it seems. I've only worked and pushed from repos where I am listed as a collaborator, so making a fork and making pull requests from that fork was something new for me.
