## Article findings
The article on finding a project to which you can contribute has a great amount of information and advice. It also has links to other webpages that help you in finding projects. Explore these links and comment on which might prove to be useful, and whether they have helped you to narrow down your search.

On link I found really interesting on the article is github explore. I only use github for my own projects, but I forgot that there are many other one's on there as well. Github.com/explore matches open issues based on my own interests. I find this very useful in narrowing down my search because I am more likely to contribute to an issue if I am familiar with it's syntax and environment. For example, the first thing github explore shows me is an issue on ``` .post(), .put(), and .patch() functions in API docs missing 'files' parameter```. I have experience using post, put and patch; therefore fixing this issue still would take some time, but not as long as learning something from scratch.

## Comments about this week's git activity

This week's github lesson on making contribution was a bit confusing at first. The procedure for updating the master repo from a forked repo was not as easy as it seems. I've only worked and pushed from repos where I am listed as a collaborator, so making a fork and making pull requests from that fork was something new for me.
