My group did an evaluation on Gatsby, a modern website generator powered by react js. During our evaluation, we mainly dug through the github repo to find all of the information needed. During this process, we also discovered the insights tab which shows very niche information over a period of time such as pull requests, commits, any new contributors and more. The hardest parts of the evaluation was finding very specific data such as the total lines of code or when the project was first released. For the lines of code, we used openhub.net to find lots of meta data on the project. TO find the first release date, I look back at the commit history of the license file, until I saw the commit that was title inital release. From the evaluation, It definitely made me more interested in the project, it also made me more knowledgeable as to how to find meta data information about a project using openhub or the insights tab.
