What I learned from the 10 things about open source software.

Most open source software often uses Git as its version control system.

I learned that in order for the project to be considered open source, it needs to have collaborators from the community. Just being on Github does not mean it is open source.

Anyone who uses your open source product must abide by the rules that you placed in the lisence. They cannot just run off with it and do whatever. Some lisences let you modify it and repackage it into whatever you with, but some only distrubute in moderation.
