I was very suprised that Hunter College offered open source development because it was something that I wanted to learn more about. I know that contributing to open source will further my understanding of production code as well as help me build my porfolio. Knowing version control softwares like GIT is a must in modern day tech companies especially when trying to collaborate with others on an exisiting codebase. I have learned git over the summer, but I want to expand my knowledge until it can be applicable in my future roles.
