## Kevin Flemming Visit

Kevin Flemming from Bloomberg LP came to talk about what he does at Bloomberg and how his role affects the open source world. Bloomberg's product is called Bloomberg Terminal, which is a subscription based solution that is mainly sold to finanical companies. The product is a finanical tool used to predict market and stock prices. The product is used heavily by many fortune 500 companies and some cannot function without using it daily.

## Wikipedia Contributions

I made to edit to Hunter College's wikipedia page. I noticed when reading the page, there was no note that the Tau sculpture in front of the west building has been removed for restoration. So I just added a [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hunter_College&oldid=926049581) saying that it has been removed.
