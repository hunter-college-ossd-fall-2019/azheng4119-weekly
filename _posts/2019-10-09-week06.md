## Session with Karen Sandler

This week's presentation by Karen Sandler was a very informative session that helped my understanding of the importance of software freedom. Her anecdotes to her personal life and issues really tied in the importance of it for me. Her struggle of trying to get the attention of her pacemaker's company brought to my attention how real and potentially life threatening this situtation can be. Ultimately her talk, put me into perspective that the topics we were discussing in class goes beyond the classroom.
