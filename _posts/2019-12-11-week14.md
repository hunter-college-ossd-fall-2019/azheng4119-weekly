## Reflection On First Few Posts

Upon reading my first few posts in my blog, I can say that this course has fufilled my expectations. My point about Github version control being a very important factor in companies still stands true. During this course, I have learn much more about using git, especially concepts such as rebasing and merging. I only knew the basic commands like add, pull and push, but now I know the deeper meaning behind it. As for my first contributions, I expected to make small contributions and that ended up being somewhat true. My first contributions were entries into a JSON object to add brands. My goal of working on a game client didn't play out like I wanted, but that might just be something for the future now that I know a lot more about contributing. I am still interested in those types of contributions, but my selected projected this semester has brought to my attention all of the other different projects that are available to contribute to.

## Future Plans

For the future, I am happy to say that I have accepted an offer at Amazon for the position of Software Development Engineer. I hope to work with any open source efforts that Amazon's teams might offer and use what I learned in this course to contribute. Anyone that is reading this blog and is having thoughts on wether to take this course or not, take it! It really opens your mind to what is out there and shows how you can make a difference.
