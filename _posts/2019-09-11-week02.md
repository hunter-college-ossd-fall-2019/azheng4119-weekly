## First Contributions

My first contributions would be something very small. My strengths include debugging so maybe just fixing error that people have in an open source project. Making features would be something that I would be comfortable doing only if I am exposed to the codebase for a long period of time.

Some projects that interests me are game clients. I can see myself contributing by either making plugins for those clients or new mods. My biggest roadblock is that learning the code base can be very overwhelming at first because there is already an established code base that requires reading and understanding thousands upon thousands lines of code.
