## Project Report

I forked a copy of [Name Suggestion index](https://github.com/azheng4119/name-suggestion-index) into my own github. I
made another contributing to Name Suggestion Index this week. This is the [pull request](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index/pull/3268) I made to close this [issue](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index/issues/3236). This is the second PR that has been accepted. The issues that I have selected involves adding companies and their descriptions to a json file. These issues can take anywhere from 10-15mins due to the research needed behind them. This week's issue, I've added Bapco, which is a oil and gas company, into the canonical list. I found the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_Petroleum_Company) and the [wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q803640) and added them to the data item.
