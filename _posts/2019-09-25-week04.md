## Experience

Experience on using Git in class was a review for me. I've been using GitHub very actively this past summer and find it amazing. The only part I did not finish was adding my name to the README because I believe member one was absent that day. I did help a person out next to me. He had an issue with trying to push without adding any files to the staging area and commiting first. Issue was resolve after adding the file.

One thing I learned from reading the articles is that when making commit messages; I shouldn't make the message about two or more unrelated tasks. Each commit should be specific to a certain task that I did so that when someone looks at the commit history, they can see exactly what code I changed and if the code changed includes two or more tasks then it can throw that person off.

## Git editing assignment

For the Git editing assignment, I edited a few spelling and grammar mistakes across 2-3 blogs from the user with the handle `R-Ligier`. The process for making making these edits were different from the class assignment because the repo that I am trying to edit does not have me listed as a contributor. I had to first fork the repo into my own so that I could push changes to it. Once I was finished making edits to the blogs, I opened a pull request on the original user's repo. It is now up to that user to review my request and accept or decline accordingly.
