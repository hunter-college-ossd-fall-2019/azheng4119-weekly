## The Cathedral and the Bazaar



## Selected Project

I project that I have selected is still [Name suggestion Index](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index). This week, I focused on selecting the issues that I would be working on. I have chosen the one's that are marked as `Hacktoberfest` because those are geared towards people that are newer to open source. I made my first [pull request](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index/pull/3220) on the issue [#3176](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index/issues/3176). When I woke up, the pull request was accepted with a minor edit to my commit. The experience was very smooth and exciting as this is my first contribution outside of my own projects.

## Weekly Summary
* Made my first pull request to my selected project
* Three edits on Open Street Maps
