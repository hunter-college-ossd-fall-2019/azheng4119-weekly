## Humanitarian Project

The project that peeked my interests is titled [Half of the worldâ€™s languages are dying. Should we save them?](https://opensource.com/article/17/7/half-world-languages-dying-save-them). I immediately picked this post because I can relate to it to some level. My family speaks a few dialects of chinese and I cannot seem to pick them up. I could only learn English as it was the only one that stuck to me. I am scared that I would not be able to pass down the language. As the article states, one language out of the 7,000 is dying every two weeks. Looking at the problem, I would say open source can definitely help preserve some of these languages. Being able to store the language digitally with video / contextual help can definitely slow down the dying of a language. People from all over the world and also learn these languages without direct contact with these natives. 

## Tom Callaway's Post

One of the buisness that really struck me was #2 Open Core. Quite a few companies release their "core" as open source, but offer proprietary solutions using that core. The value that customers get out of is not the core, but the wrapper that the company has made using the core. One of the examples that come to mind is chromium and google chrome. Google chrome is still extremely profitable, and it's core is open sourced.

Another interesting model is #5 FUD. This model relies on the customers being scared touching your open source code, therefore purchasing a license to skip the hassle. Code like MongoDB, who uses the SSPL license which states that all projects using this code, must also release every other version connected to it. Which is very undesirable for companies who need to use a small section.
