## Humanitarian Project

The project that peeked my interests is titled [Half of the worldâ€™s languages are dying. Should we save them?](https://opensource.com/article/17/7/half-world-languages-dying-save-them). I immediately picked this post because I can relate to it to some level. My family speaks a few dialects of chinese and I cannot seem to pick them up. I could only learn English as it was the only one that stuck to me. I am scared that I would not be able to pass down the language. As the article states, one language out of the 7,000 is dying every two weeks. Looking at the problem, I would say open source can definitely help preserve some of these languages. Being able to store the language digitally with video / contextual help can definitely slow down the dying of a language. People from all over the world and also learn these languages without direct contact with these natives.
