## Project

For my selected project I chose to work on [Name suggestion Index](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index). I cloned the repository on my local machine. The environment is very easy to configure. I just have to use the scripts in the package.json file to compile my code. Once compling, I can see any errors I made and anything that I can fix. A lot of the issues in the issue tab is related to either missing wikidata or missing the brand in general. For the missing wikidata, I would have to make a wikipedia page on it. For the missing brands, I would just have to research the brand and put them in the appropriate locations with the right tags. I have read the contributing markdown file and everything seems to be straight forward. In this project, there is not nessecarily code that I need to refactor, I only need to add entities.
