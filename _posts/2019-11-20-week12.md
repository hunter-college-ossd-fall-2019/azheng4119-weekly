## Election Fraud Reading

## Project

Made another [pull request](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index/pull/3391) to add John L. Scott real estate company to the list. This closes issue #[3360](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index/issues/3360). When I was making this PR, I ran into the issue of not having my version updated with the original version of the project. It first gave a conflict when I tried to submit the PR, but I fixed this by setting the original as a remote and pulled all the changes into my copy.
